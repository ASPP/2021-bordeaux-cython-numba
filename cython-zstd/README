zstd is currently one of the best compression algorithms.
It doesn't achieve the highest compression ratios known, but is close.
It is orders of magnitude faster than compressors with similar efficiency.

/usr/include/zstd.h defines a set of functions to compress and decompress data.
Add the missing pieces in wrap_zstd.pyx to call those functions.

test_wrap_zstd.py will try to import wrap_zstd and call .compress() and .decompress().
