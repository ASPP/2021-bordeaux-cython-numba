prange() doesn't seem to always work in the ipython notebook with %%cython magic.
By doing the compilation manually, we can control the details and see any warnings:

On the commandline:

cython -3 mean_filter.pyx
gcc -O3 -shared -fPIC -o mean_filter.so mean_filter.c -fopenmp $(pkgconf python3 --cflags --libs)

In IPython:

import mean_filter
import numpy as np
arr = np.random.rand(10**6)
%timeit mean_filter.mean3filter4(arr)
